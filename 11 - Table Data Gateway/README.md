# Table Data Gateway

Wait a second...

What about active record?

The Problem:

Mixed business & database logic

## Table Data Gateway

The Table Data Gateway extracts all the database interactions from the model to a single unified location.

Drawbacks:

- Only designed for groups of objects (entire tables)
- Not good for multiple/complex relationships
