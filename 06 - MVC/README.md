## The problem

Spaghetti Code

# Model View Controller

The MVC pattern separates the concerns of the data (Model) from the presentation of the data (View) and manipulating the data (Controller).

Better architecture?

Drawbacks

- The model could be incomplete (validation in the model)
- The controller should just dispatch commands
- Basically, the controller could do too much
